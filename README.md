# STL-finder
Visually find STL-files on your local hard drive.

When you download, create or print a lot of STL files it is hard to keep track of what kind of 3d objects you have. With this tool you can inspect a folder to see what STL files are there.

It works by a local PHP instance (php -S localhost:8099) to show the files in a folder. There is also a Nemo (Linux Mint's file manager) script to jump to the STL-finder from within Nemo.
